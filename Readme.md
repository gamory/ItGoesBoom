# It Goes Boom
## Description
This is planned to be sort of a generic tool for reloading.  I'm hoping to add in things such as inventory management and rudimentary ballistic calulations.

## Warning
If you read the above discription, you know what this is for reloading.  If you don't realize that reloading (and using firearms in general) are potentially dangerous 
hobbies; this really isn't for you.

Every reasonable effort is going to be made for accuracy.  This is a tool that first and foremost _I intend to use_.  Obviously I don't have any great desire to be 
injured.  However, you really should be double checking data yourself.  Even a cursory look at a reloading manual (or several) is a good idea.

So, you can probably guess that this comes with no warranty, no guaranties, and I will not be held accountable for any problems/injuries/damage.
